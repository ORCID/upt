# Upt
**U**niversal **P**ackage-management **T**ool for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Upt recongizes your input, and interprets it into the command which invokes the native package management tool.

For example, if your input `brew install vim` or `upt install vim` on `Ubutu`, upt will recongize that your want to install vim, then execute `apt install vim`.

## Install

- **From binaries**
   Binaries are available for download [here][releases]. Make sure to put the path to the binary into your `PATH`.

<!-- - **From Crates.io**

   This requires at least [Rust] 1.20 and Cargo to be installed. Once you have installed
   Rust, type the following in the terminal:

   ```
   cargo install upt
   ```

   This will download and compile upt for you, the only thing left to do is
   to add the Cargo bin directory to your `PATH`. -->

- **For Contributions**  

   If you want to contribute to upt  you will have to clone the repository on
   your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sigoden/upt.git
   ```

   `cd` into `upt/` and run

   ```
   cargo build
   ```

   The resulting binary can be found in `upt/target/debug/` under the name
   `upt` or `upt.exe`.

## Usage

Upt is not only a command line tool but also an interpreter.

As a command line, it can:

- Install packges: `upt install cargo`, `upt install -y cargo code`(No yes/No prompt)
- Remove packages: `upt remove cargo`, `upt remove -y cargo code`(No yes/No prompt)
- Remove packages: `upt upgrade cargo`, `upt upgrade -y cargo code`(No yes/No prompt)
- Search for packges:  `upt search cargo`
- Show package details:  `upt show cargo`
- Show indexes of packages:  `upt update`
- Upgrade all packages :  `upt upgrade`
- List installed packages: `upt -i`
- List upgradable packages: `upt -u`

> For general purpose, upt only provide most general and useful commands.

As a interpreter, it can act as other command line tool.

Rename `upt` to `pacman`, your can take advantage of your `pacman` experience to manage packages. It becomes `pacman`. Type `pacman -S cargo` to install cargo other than `pacman install cargo`ã€‚
